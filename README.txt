maxmspThreePianos

Another variation on the MaxMSP step sequencer theme.

The basis is three pianos, or rather, three octaves from the same
piano. Imagine a pianist with three hands.

Each octave has two respective configurable parameters: frequency and
volume. These are controlled by the windows along the top of the panel. By
using three octaves, multi-octave chords are possible, and the addition
of configurable volume gives loops some life.

Additionally, you can load in a drum loop to play alongside the piano
loop. This can be matched to the piano loop tempo for sync.
